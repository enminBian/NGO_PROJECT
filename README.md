# About Partner In Health

Partner In Health is a global health and social justice organization that responds to the moral imperative to provide high-quality health care globally to those who need it most.

Partner In Health strives to ease suffering by placing patients at the center of all care, meeting not only their physical, but also their mental, emotional, and daily needs so that they can recover from illness and maintain good health.
